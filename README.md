# Python-Assignments-Bioinformatics
This is a space that shares the assignments from the Introduction to Python course focused on bioinformatics for health sciences. Most of the problems are focused on biological analysis. 

This introductory part of the repository is focused on giving you suggestions of the workflow that I used for the course and that I would have liked to apply at the beginning. 
PD: I am not an expert in the area but I hope these suggestions will help you not to be lost when you start learning this programming language.

- If you don't have it already, download and use Visual Studio Code(VSC). Yes, I know it is windows and there are many experts who may not like it, but it is easy to use for a beginner and user friendly. You can use extensions to help you with different things not only in this course but also in the others. One extension that helped me was to display the PDF files in the VSC.
- Definitely download Python on your local pc and then link it to VSC. (This way you will be able to work with python from VSC and manage all your scripts and so on easily).
